# PoggioAI/MSc
### Proof-Oriented Generative General Intelligence Orchestration: Agentic Investigation / Multi-agent Scientific Consortium

[Website](https://PoggioAI.github.io) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/Pz7spPPY) | [Paper](https://PoggioAI.github.io) | [GitHub](https://github.com/PierBeneventano/OpenPI)

**Goal:** In our experience, moving from a strong human-developed idea to a solid machine-learning-theory manuscript still often takes on the order of $10^2$ to $10^3$ prompts---if possible at all---with frontier reasoning models and agentic systems as Claude Code or GPT Pro. The goal here is to bring this down to 0-10 user prompts (steers).

**PoggioAI/MSc** is an open-source, customizable, modular multi-agent system for academic research workflows. Our goal is not autonomous scientific ideation, nor fully automated research. It is narrower and more practical: to reduce by orders of magnitude the human steering required to turn a specified hypothesis into a literature-grounded, mathematically established, experimentally supported, submission-oriented manuscript draft. Built with a current emphasis on machine learning theory and adjacent quantitative fields.

The system implements a fixed workflow that decomposes work into 23+ specialist nodes across literature, theory, experiment, synthesis, and writing phases, with repair and follow-up routes when artifacts are incomplete, inconsistent, not novel, or not adequately established. Progress is represented by named intermediate outputs and stage-level validation gates (the *artifact contract*) rather than by free-form dialogue alone. Optional rigor-enhancing components include theorem-oriented reasoning, multi-model debate counsel, and tree-search-based exploration.

(The core Python package is named `consortium`; **PoggioAI/MSc** is the project name.)

- License: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Runtime: Python 3.11 (recommended via conda)
- Entry point: `launch_multiagent.py`
- Core package: `consortium/`

> Runtime note: the launcher now runs a fixed workflow graph. `--pipeline-mode` is accepted for backward compatibility but ignored.

### Important Remarks

This project was entirely vibecoded in about 3 weeks (Claude Code + Cursor). However, our cumulative years of beliefs of how ML research should be done are hard-coded into the `md` files. In the prehistory of this project, we were inspired by [freephdlabor](https://github.com/ltjed/freephdlabor) and [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/).

Make sure you deeply read and review the papers that PoggioAI develops, run some sanity-check thorough deep researches to check novelty and related work, and ask your reasoning model of choice to deeply and thoroughly proofcheck all the claims!

We hope this will be helpful for you! If you like this project please support us on social media! If PoggioAI helped you with your research please acknowledge us!

## 5-Minute Quickstart

> **Cost**: included in your subscription plan (Claude Max, ChatGPT Pro, Gemini Advanced, etc.) -- no per-token costs | **Time**: 15-40 min | **Requires**: at least one CLI agent tool installed
>
> **Prerequisites**: [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Miniconda or Anaconda) and at least one CLI agent tool installed (`claude`, `codex`, and/or `gemini`).

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap environment (one-time, ~5 min)
./scripts/bootstrap.sh researchlab minimal

conda activate researchlab

# 2. Install CLI agent tools (only one provider needed)
#    Claude:  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
#    Codex:   npm install -g @openai/codex
#    Gemini:  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli   # or install via pip
# Then authenticate each tool per its own docs (e.g., `claude auth login`).

# 3. Validate setup without running the pipeline
python launch_multiagent.py --task "test" --dry-run

# 4. Run the included quickstart example (produces markdown paper draft)
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "$(cat examples/quickstart/task.txt)" \
  --output-format markdown \
  --no-counsel \
  --no-log-to-files
```

After the run, look in `results/consortium_<timestamp>/` for:
- `final_paper.md` -- the generated paper draft
- `paper_workspace/literature_review.pdf` -- literature synthesis
- `budget_state.json` -- invocation count and wall-clock time used

**Want a full paper with LaTeX/PDF?** Install LaTeX (`./scripts/bootstrap.sh researchlab latex`) and drop `--output-format markdown`.

**Want multi-model quality?** Add `--enable-counsel` (requires claude + codex + gemini CLI tools installed).

**Want math theorem verification?** Add `--enable-math-agents` (see [Math Workflow](#math-workflow)).

## What This Platform Does

Given a `--task`, the active single-run LangGraph workflow:

1. Explores the problem through ideation and literature review
2. Builds a research plan and writes `paper_workspace/track_decomposition.json`
3. Launches the theory track, experiment track, or both in parallel based on that decomposition
4. Merges and synthesizes track outputs, then runs results analysis and a follow-up decision
5. Loops back to planning when more theory or experiments are needed
6. Prepares resources, writes the paper, proofreads it, reviews it, and runs final validation gates
7. Optionally enables theorem/proof work via `--enable-math-agents`
8. Optionally enables multi-model debate at each specialist stage via `--enable-counsel`
9. Optionally enables agentic tree search (`--enable-tree-search`) to explore multiple proof strategies in parallel via DAG-layered best-first search
10. Supports autonomous multi-stage campaigns via OpenClaw or cron (`OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md`)

Runs are resumable through LangGraph checkpoints (`checkpoints.db`) and can be steered live over TCP/HTTP.

## Guarantees and Non-Guarantees

### What PoggioAI/MSc Guarantees

- **Workflow execution**: Given valid CLI agent tools and a task prompt, the pipeline will execute every stage in the fixed workflow graph and produce the documented artifacts.
- **Artifact generation**: Each stage produces its mandatory output files (see [Quality Gates and Artifact Contracts](#quality-gates-and-artifact-contracts)).
- **Budget enforcement**: The pipeline will halt before exceeding the configured invocation count or wall-clock time limit.
- **Checkpointing**: Every completed stage is persisted to SQLite. A crashed run can be resumed from the last checkpoint.
- **Validation gates**: When `--enforce-paper-artifacts` or `--enforce-editorial-artifacts` are enabled, the pipeline will not report success unless the specified artifacts exist and pass structural checks.

### What PoggioAI/MSc Does NOT Guarantee

- **Scientific correctness**: All generated claims, proofs, experimental results, and literature citations require human verification before any submission or publication.
- **Reproducibility across runs**: LLM outputs are stochastic. Two runs with the same task and model will produce different papers.
- **Calibrated review scores**: The reviewer agent's `overall_score` is an internal heuristic used to drive the revision loop. It is not a calibrated acceptance probability and should not be interpreted as a prediction of peer-review outcome.
- **Novelty**: The ideation agent searches existing literature but cannot guarantee that a generated idea is truly novel. Manual novelty verification is required.
- **Factual accuracy of citations**: Citation metadata is fetched from arXiv and Semantic Scholar. Papers may be miscited, misattributed, or retracted.
- **Code correctness**: Experiment code is AI-generated. Results may contain bugs, incorrect baselines, or misleading metrics.

## Known Limitations

1. **No ground-truth verification**: The pipeline has no oracle for scientific truth. Quality gates check structural completeness (file exists, score above threshold), not factual accuracy.
2. **Reviewer score is not calibrated**: `--min-review-score 8` means "the LLM reviewer assigned 8/10," not "this paper has an 80% chance of acceptance." The score distribution depends on the model, prompt, and paper domain.
3. **Experiment execution has no OS-level sandboxing**: `RunExperimentTool` launches the experiment runner as a subprocess on the host (or via SLURM). There is no Docker container, cgroup, or resource-limit enforcement beyond a configurable timeout. See [Experiment Execution Safety Model](#experiment-execution-safety-model).
4. **Single-run stochasticity**: The pipeline is a fixed workflow graph (stages always execute in the same order), but LLM outputs are non-deterministic. "Fixed workflow graph" refers to the execution topology, not output reproducibility.
5. **Budget tracking is best-effort**: Invocation counts and wall-clock time are tracked internally. Actual subscription usage may differ depending on provider-side accounting.
6. **LaTeX compilation failures**: The writeup agent generates LaTeX that may not compile on first attempt. The revision loop retries, but complex papers may require manual fixup.

## How the Pipeline Works

### Phase-Based Execution Graph

The pipeline is a persona-council-driven LangGraph workflow with feedback loops at multiple stages for self-correction. It executes in six phases:

**1. Discovery (Persona Council)**
- `persona_council` -- evaluates the research direction from three critical lenses (practical compass, rigor/novelty, narrative architect) via multi-round debate
- `literature_review_agent`
- `lit_review_gate` -- feasibility check; loops back to `persona_council` if infeasible
- `brainstorm_agent`
- `formalize_goals_entry` -- entry gate that prepares state for goal formalization
- `formalize_goals_agent`
- `research_plan_writeup_agent` -- drafts a structured research plan
- `track_decomposition_gate` -- validates and writes `track_decomposition.json`
- `milestone_goals` -- milestone gate (pauses for human input when milestone gates are enabled)

**2. Parallel Track Execution**
- **Theory track** (when `--enable-math-agents` is enabled and the planner selects theory work):
  - `math_literature_agent`
  - `math_proposer_agent`
  - `goal_tag_validation_gate` -- validates claim graph tags before proving
  - `math_prover_agent`
  - `math_rigorous_verifier_agent`
  - `human_review_gate` -- optional pause for human review of proofs
  - `math_empirical_verifier_agent`
  - `proof_transcription_agent`
  - `theory_track_repair_gate` -- can loop back to `math_prover_agent` for repair passes
- **Experiment track** (when the planner selects empirical work):
  - `experiment_literature_agent`
  - `experiment_design_agent`
  - `experimentation_agent`
  - `experiment_verification_agent`
  - `experiment_transcription_agent`

**3. Completion Verification**
- `track_merge`
- `verify_completion` -- three-way routing: complete (proceed), incomplete (loop to `formalize_goals_agent`), rethink (loop to `brainstorm_agent`)

**4. Results Formalization and Quality Check**
- `formalize_results_agent`
- `duality_check` -- internal consistency check (`--no-duality-check` to skip)
- `duality_gate` -- pass proceeds to paper production; fail loops to `brainstorm_agent` via `followup_lit_review`

**5. Paper Production and Final QA**
- `resource_preparation_agent`
- `writeup_agent`
- `proofreading_entry` -- entry gate that prepares state for proofreading
- `proofreading_agent`
- `reviewer_agent`
- `milestone_review` -- milestone gate (pauses for human review of the paper when enabled)
- `validation_gate` -- routes to END on pass; can loop back to `writeup_agent`, `experiment_track`, or `theory_track` on fail

If no execution tracks are selected, the graph falls through directly to `track_merge`, then continues through verify-completion.

**Counsel mode** (`--enable-counsel`): Nodes with dashed purple borders run multi-model debate when counsel is enabled. Each specialist node runs three independent CLI agent executions (claude, codex, gemini), then a debate + synthesis round before promoting consensus artifacts. See [Counsel Mode](#counsel-mode-multi-model-debate).

**Tree search** (`--enable-tree-search`): In the theory track, the linear `MathProver` stage is replaced by a tree search controller that explores multiple proof strategies in parallel via DAG-layered best-first search. Internally, each branch invokes `cli_completion()` for LLM reasoning. See [Agentic Tree Search](#agentic-tree-search).

**Pipeline-specific CLI flags**:
- `--persona-debate-rounds N` -- number of debate rounds in persona council (default: 3)
- `--no-duality-check` -- skip the duality check gate (formalize results goes directly to paper production)
- `--adversarial-verification` -- run a hostile red-team verifier after cooperative verifiers pass
- `--no-steering` -- disable TCP/HTTP live-steering sockets (for Docker or restricted environments)

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh researchlab full
conda activate researchlab

# Install at least one CLI agent tool (see Installation for details)
# Then validate:
python scripts/preflight_check.py --with-docs --with-web --with-experiment --with-latex

# Recommended first run (single-backend):
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Investigate this topic and produce a paper draft with evidence-backed claims." \
  --output-format markdown \
  --no-counsel \
  --no-log-to-files
```

Artifacts are written to `results/consortium_<timestamp>/`.

## Installation (Detailed)

### Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- At least one CLI agent tool installed: `claude`, `codex`, and/or `gemini`

### Standard Bootstrap

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh <env_name> <profile>
```

Supported profiles:

- `minimal`: core runtime
- `docs`: document/audio parsing stack
- `web`: web crawling stack + Playwright Chromium install
- `experiment`: experiment tool dependencies
- `latex`: TeX toolchain (`pdflatex`, `bibtex`)
- `full`: all capabilities

Profiles can be combined:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh researchlab minimal,web
```

### Alternative: Cross-Platform Conda Spec

```bash
conda env create -f environment.cross-platform.yml
conda activate consortium
```

This installs the core runtime without running bootstrap scripts. You must also copy the config template manually:

```bash
cp .llm_config.yaml.example .llm_config.yaml
```

### CLI Agent Tools

Install at least one CLI agent backend. These are the tools the pipeline shells out to for LLM completions (via `cli_completion.py` and `cli_agent.py`):

```bash
# Claude (Anthropic) -- requires a Claude Max or Team subscription
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth login

# Codex (OpenAI) -- requires a ChatGPT Pro or Plus subscription
npm install -g @openai/codex
# Authenticate per codex docs

# Gemini (Google) -- requires a Gemini Advanced subscription
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli
# Authenticate per gemini-cli docs
```

Counsel mode requires all three CLI tools (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`) to be installed and authenticated.

### Preflight Validation

```bash
python scripts/preflight_check.py --with-docs --with-web --with-experiment --with-latex
```

Remove flags for capabilities you did not install.

## Configuration

### Backend Selection Precedence

Backend and model settings are resolved in this order:

1. Built-in defaults in `consortium/runner.py` (fallback if no config found)
2. `.llm_config.yaml`
3. CLI overrides (`--model`, `--reasoning-effort`, `--verbosity`)

### `.llm_config.yaml` (Current Repository Defaults)

```yaml
default_backend: claude          # CLI backend: claude | codex | gemini
default_model: claude-sonnet-4-6 # model passed to the CLI backend
timeout_seconds: 300             # per-invocation timeout
budget:
  max_invocations: 200           # max CLI agent invocations per run
  max_wall_clock_seconds: 7200   # hard wall-clock limit for the entire run
counsel:
  enabled: false                 # requires all 3 CLI tools; enable after setup
per_agent_models:
  enabled: false                 # all agents use the default backend/model
```

Counsel precedence:

- `--no-counsel` disables counsel even if enabled in config
- `--enable-counsel` enables counsel even if disabled in config
- If neither flag is passed, config value is used

### Supported `--model` Values

The `--model` flag selects the model identifier passed to the active CLI backend. Common values:

- **claude backend**: `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`
- **codex backend**: `gpt-5`, `gpt-5.4`, `o3-2025-04-16`, `gpt-4o`
- **gemini backend**: `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash`

The backend determines which CLI tool is invoked; the model flag is forwarded to that tool. Any model string accepted by the underlying CLI tool will work.

### Budget and Invocation Tracking

Budget files in each workspace:

- `budget_state.json`
- `budget_ledger.jsonl`
- `budget.lock` (present when cap is reached)

The budget system tracks:

- **Invocation count**: number of CLI agent calls made during the run
- **Wall-clock time**: elapsed time since the run started

These replace per-token USD cost tracking. Since CLI agent tools are included in subscription plans (Claude Max, ChatGPT Pro, Gemini Advanced, etc.), there are no per-token costs to track.

### Useful Environment Variables

- LaTeX overrides: `CONSORTIUM_PDFLATEX_PATH`, `CONSORTIUM_BIBTEX_PATH`
- Logging/tracing: `CONSORTIUM_LOG_TO_FILES`, `CONSORTIUM_ENABLE_TRACING`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`
- Agent behavior: `CONSORTIUM_VLM_MODEL`, `CONSORTIUM_ENABLE_MANAGER_TEXT_INSPECTOR`, `CONSORTIUM_WIPE_CONFIRM_TOKEN`
- Counsel override: `CONSORTIUM_COUNSEL_MAX_DEBATE_ROUNDS`
- Citation controls: `CONSORTIUM_SS_MAX_RETRIES`, `CONSORTIUM_SS_BASE_DELAY_SEC`, `CONSORTIUM_SS_COOLDOWN_SEC`, `CONSORTIUM_SS_TIMEOUT_SEC`
- Cache controls: `CONSORTIUM_CITATION_CACHE_TTL_SEC`, `CONSORTIUM_CITATION_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`
- Tool output bounds: `CONSORTIUM_SEE_FILE_MAX_CHARS`, `CONSORTIUM_SEARCH_MAX_CHARS`, `CONSORTIUM_SEARCH_MAX_MATCHES`

## Common Run Commands

### Basic Run (Recommended First Run)

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Investigate this direction and produce a draft with supporting evidence." \
  --no-counsel
```

### Strict Paper Run

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Run the full literature-to-paper workflow with strict artifact checks." \
  --no-counsel \
  --followup-max-iterations 3 \
  --enforce-paper-artifacts \
  --enforce-editorial-artifacts \
  --min-review-score 8 \
  --require-pdf
```

### Run with Math Agents

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Include theorem/proof work and integrate accepted claims into the paper." \
  --enable-math-agents \
  --no-counsel
```

### Run with Model Counsel

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Run each specialist stage with multi-model debate and synthesis." \
  --enable-counsel \
  --enable-math-agents \
  --enforce-paper-artifacts \
  --require-pdf
```

Counsel runs use all three CLI backends in parallel (claude + codex + gemini) and are significantly slower per specialist stage.

### Run with Tree Search (Parallel Proof Strategies)

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Prove convergence of the proposed optimizer and explore alternative proof strategies." \
  --enable-math-agents \
  --enable-tree-search \
  --tree-max-breadth 3 \
  --tree-max-depth 4 \
  --no-counsel
```

### Run with Tree Search + Counsel (Maximum Quality)

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Full exploration with parallel strategies and multi-model debate at every branch." \
  --enable-math-agents \
  --enable-tree-search \
  --enable-counsel \
  --tree-counsel-mode all_nodes \
  --enforce-paper-artifacts \
  --require-pdf
```

Tree search with counsel at every node is the most resource-intensive configuration.

### Maximum Quality (All Features)

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --task "Full run with tree search, counsel, and adversarial verification." \
  --enable-math-agents \
  --enable-counsel \
  --enable-tree-search \
  --tree-counsel-mode all_nodes \
  --persona-debate-rounds 5 \
  --adversarial-verification \
  --enforce-paper-artifacts \
  --require-pdf
```

This enables persona council evaluation, feasibility gating, verify-completion feedback loops, duality checking, tree search, and multi-model counsel. Use `--no-duality-check` to skip the duality gate.

## Resume and Stage-Based Resume

### Resume a Workspace

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --resume /absolute/path/to/results/consortium_<timestamp> \
  --task "Continue from current artifacts and improve the final deliverable."
```

### Start From a Specific Stage

`--start-from-stage` requires `--resume`:

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --resume /absolute/path/to/results/consortium_<timestamp> \
  --start-from-stage experimentation \
  --task "Re-run experimentation and downstream stages with tighter controls." \
  --no-counsel
```

Accepted names include canonical IDs and common aliases, for example:

- `persona_council`, `literature_review`, `brainstorm`, `formalize_goals`, `experimentation`
- `formalize_results`, `resource_preparation`, `writeup`, `proofreading`, `reviewer`
- math aliases like `math_prover`, `math_rigorous_verifier`, `proof_transcription` (when math agents are enabled)

### Provide Context Files (`.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt`)

```bash
mkdir -p /absolute/path/to/results/consortium_<timestamp>/inputs
```

Put your files in `inputs/`, then resume with a task that tells agents how to use them.

## Stable Task Templates

The repo includes staged task templates under `automation_tasks/`.

### Step 1: Theory Task

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --enable-math-agents \
  --no-counsel \
  --task "$(cat automation_tasks/run1_theory_task_stable.txt)"
```

### Step 2: Experiment Task (resume same workspace)

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --resume /absolute/path/to/results/consortium_<timestamp> \
  --no-counsel \
  --task "$(cat automation_tasks/run2_experiment_task_stable.txt)"
```

### Step 3: Paper Task (resume same workspace)

```bash
python launch_multiagent.py \
  --resume /absolute/path/to/results/consortium_<timestamp> \
  --no-counsel \
  --task "$(cat automation_tasks/run3_paper_task_stable.txt)"
```

These templates define a **campaign-style multi-run workflow** (`theory -> experiment -> paper`). That campaign-level sequencing is separate from the **single-run internal graph**, which now does planner-driven parallel theory/experiment routing inside one run.

## Live Steering During a Run

Launcher opens (unless `--no-steering` is passed):

- TCP control socket at `--callback_host:--callback_port` (default `127.0.0.1:5001`)
- HTTP steering API at `callback_port + 1` (default `5002`)

Use `--no-steering` to disable socket binding entirely (e.g., in Docker containers or shared servers where ports may be restricted).

### TCP Steering

```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 5001
```

Then send:

1. `interrupt` (or `stop` / `pause`)
2. Your instruction
3. Empty line, empty line
4. `m` (modify current task) or `n` (new task)

### HTTP Steering

```bash
# Pause
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5002/interrupt

# Inject instruction
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5002/instruction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"focus on linear case only","type":"m"}'

# Check status
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5002/status
```

## OpenClaw Campaign Orchestration

The campaign system repeatedly calls `scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py`, which manages stage launches, artifact validation, cross-stage memory distillation, autonomous failure repair, budget tracking, and push notifications. For the full guide on campaign configuration, task file authoring, and failure recovery, see [`OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md`](OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md).

> **OpenClaw is optional.** You can run campaigns without OpenClaw by calling the heartbeat script manually or via system cron. OpenClaw adds Telegram-based monitoring and a convenient scheduling layer, but the core campaign logic lives entirely in `scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py` and `scripts/campaign_cli.py`.

### Running Without OpenClaw

```bash
# 1. Initialize the campaign
python scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py --campaign my_campaign.yaml --init

# 2. Launch the first stage
python scripts/campaign_cli.py --campaign my_campaign.yaml launch discovery_plan

# 3. Run heartbeat ticks manually (or add to crontab)
python scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py --campaign my_campaign.yaml

# 4. Check status
python scripts/campaign_cli.py --campaign my_campaign.yaml status
```

To automate without OpenClaw, add a crontab entry:
```bash
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/OpenPI && python scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py --campaign my_campaign.yaml >> logs/heartbeat.log 2>&1
```

### Integration Surfaces

1. **Campaign heartbeat (scheduling + stage advancement)**
   OpenClaw calls `scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py` on an interval.

2. **HTTP steering API (mid-run control)**
   While a stage is running, OpenClaw can pause and inject instructions through the REST API (`/interrupt`, `/instruction`, `/status`) on `callback_port + 1` (default `5002`).

3. **Autonomous repair agent (failure recovery)**
   When a stage fails, the heartbeat can deploy a Claude Code agent to diagnose and fix the issue before escalating to a human. See [Autonomous Repair Agent](#autonomous-repair-agent).

### Heartbeat Commands

```bash
# Initialize campaign state (safe to re-run)
python scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py --campaign campaign.yaml --init

# Heartbeat tick (call every N minutes from OpenClaw/cron)
python scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py --campaign campaign.yaml

# Show status
python scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py --campaign campaign.yaml --status

# Optional: force advance past a stuck/failed stage
python scripts/campaign_heartbeat.py --campaign campaign.yaml --force-advance
```

### Heartbeat Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Orchestrator action |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Campaign complete | Stop scheduling |
| `1` | In progress / no action this tick | Keep scheduling |
| `2` | Stage failed (repair exhausted) | Pause scheduling and alert operator |
| `3` | Stage advanced this tick | Continue scheduling (often with a shorter next interval) |

### Stage State Machine

Each campaign stage transitions through a state machine tracked in `campaign_status.json`. The `repairing` state is entered when the autonomous repair agent is attempting to fix a failed stage.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending
    pending --> in_progress : heartbeat launches stage
    in_progress --> completed : PID exits + artifacts present
    in_progress --> failed : PID exits + artifacts missing
    failed --> repairing : repair agent deployed
    repairing --> pending : repair succeeded
    repairing --> failed : repair failed
    failed --> pending : manual reset
    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*] : max attempts exceeded
```

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Waiting for dependencies to complete or for first launch |
| `in_progress` | Stage subprocess is running (PID tracked) |
| `completed` | Process exited and all required artifacts are present |
| `failed` | Process exited but required artifacts are missing |
| `repairing` | Autonomous repair agent is attempting to fix the failure |

States are defined as constants in `consortium/campaign/status.py`.

### Autonomous Repair Agent

When a stage fails, the heartbeat can deploy a **Claude Code coding agent** (`claude -p`) to diagnose and fix the issue autonomously. The repair agent uses a two-phase plan-then-execute flow with an LLM judge gate between phases.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    fail["Stage FAILED"] --> plan["Phase 1: Plan\n(read-only Claude Code)"]
    plan --> review{"LLM Judge Review\nscore >= 7/10?"}
    review -->|"approved"| execute["Phase 2: Execute\n(full-access Claude Code)"]
    review -->|"rejected"| escalate["Escalate / retry"]
    execute --> recheck{"Artifacts\nnow present?"}
    recheck -->|"yes"| relaunch["Mark PENDING\n+ relaunch stage"]
    recheck -->|"no"| retry{"Attempts\nremaining?"}
    retry -->|"yes"| plan
    retry -->|"no"| human["Escalate to human"]
```

**Phase 1 (Plan)**: Claude Code runs in read-only mode (`--permission-mode plan`) with only `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, and `Bash` tools. It produces a structured diagnosis and repair plan.

**Plan Review**: An LLM judge (via `cli_completion()`) scores the plan on 5 dimensions (correctness, completeness, safety, minimality, feasibility). Plans scoring below `min_review_score` (default 7/10) are rejected.

**Phase 2 (Execute)**: If approved, Claude Code runs with full access (`--permission-mode bypassPermissions`) to implement the approved plan.

**Launcher modes**: `local` runs Claude Code as a blocking subprocess (~10 min max). `slurm` submits the repair as a SLURM batch job and polls for completion on subsequent heartbeat ticks via a JSON sentinel file.

Configuration (in `campaign.yaml`):

```yaml
repair:
  enabled: true
  max_attempts: 2               # repair tries per stage before escalating
  launcher: slurm               # "local" (blocking) or "slurm" (async)
  model: claude-opus-4-6        # strongest model for repair
  effort: max                   # maximum thinking effort
  two_phase: true               # plan→review→execute flow
  min_review_score: 7           # plan must score >= 7/10 to proceed
  max_invocations: 50           # per-attempt invocation cap
```

Full configuration schema is in `consortium/campaign/spec.py` (`RepairConfig` dataclass).

### Circuit Breakers

The campaign system includes several circuit breakers to prevent death loops -- situations where the heartbeat keeps ticking without making progress.

| Circuit Breaker | Config Field | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Idle tick limit** | `max_idle_ticks` | `6` | After N consecutive heartbeat ticks with no action (no stage launched, completed, or failed), the heartbeat exits with code 0 to stop the cron/loop. |
| **Campaign wall time** | `max_campaign_hours` | `48` (0=unlimited) | Hard wall-time limit for the entire campaign. If elapsed time since the first stage launch exceeds this, the campaign halts. |
| **Repair backoff** | `repair.backoff_base_seconds` / `backoff_max_seconds` | `60` / `900` | Exponential backoff between repair attempts: `min(base * 2^(N-1), cap)`. Prevents rapid-fire repair retries. |
| **REPAIRING timeout** | `repair.repairing_timeout_seconds` | `3600` | If a stage stays in `REPAIRING` status longer than this (e.g., SLURM repair job hung), it is marked `FAILED`. |
| **Review failure cap** | `repair.max_review_failures` | `3` | After N consecutive LLM review failures, plans are rejected instead of auto-approved. Prevents unreviewed repairs from executing repeatedly. |
| **Counsel model timeout** | `counsel_model_timeout_seconds` | `600` | Per-model timeout for counsel sandbox and debate phases. Models that exceed this are skipped with a timeout label. |
| **Escalation timeout** | `repair.escalation_timeout_minutes` | `60` | If a failed stage sits with repair exhausted for longer than this, the repair attempt counter is reset and repair retries with a fresh budget. Controlled by `auto_retry_on_timeout`. |
| **Artifact content validation** | `artifact_validators` (per-stage) | -- | Validates artifact content beyond file existence: `min_size_bytes`, `must_contain`, `must_not_contain`. Detects hollow artifacts (e.g., `"status": "not_executed"`). |

Configuration example (`campaign_v2.yaml`):

```yaml
max_idle_ticks: 6
max_campaign_hours: 48
counsel_model_timeout_seconds: 600

repair:
  backoff_base_seconds: 60
  backoff_max_seconds: 900
  repairing_timeout_seconds: 3600
  max_review_failures: 3
  escalation_timeout_minutes: 60
  auto_retry_on_timeout: true

stages:
  - id: experiment1
    artifact_validators:
      experiment_results.json:
        min_size_bytes: 100
        must_not_contain:
          - '"status": "not_executed"'
```

### Memory Distillation

After each stage completes, `distill_stage_memory()` reads key output files from the workspace and writes a concise markdown summary to `campaign_dir/memory/<stage_id>_summary.md`. The summary includes excerpts of required artifacts (up to 4000 chars each), files from `memory_dirs` (up to 1500 chars, 20 files max), invocation counts, and pipeline status.

This summary is automatically prepended to the next stage's task prompt via `context_from`, giving downstream agents cross-stage context without inflating their full context windows. Controlled by the `memory_dirs` and `context_from` fields in stage definitions -- see [`OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md`](OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md) for details.

### Campaign Budget Management

`CampaignBudgetManager` tracks total invocations across all stages by summing per-stage `budget_state.json` files. As the campaign approaches its invocation limit, the manager recommends progressively reduced rigor levels to prevent budget exhaustion before completion.

| Rigor Level | Counsel Backends | Debate Rounds | Tree Breadth | Budget Spent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `maximum` | 3 (all CLI backends) | 3 | 3 | < 50% |
| `high` | 3 | 2 | 2 | 50-70% |
| `standard` | 2 (claude + codex) | 2 | 2 | 70-85% |
| `reduced` | 1 (claude only) | 0 | 1 (linear) | 85-95% |
| `minimal` | 0 (no counsel) | 0 | 1 | >= 95% |

Profiles are defined in `consortium/campaign/budget_manager.py` (`DEGRADATION_PROFILES`). Each profile also controls compute tier, adversarial verification, and milestone PDF generation.

### Notifications

The campaign heartbeat dispatches push notifications on stage launch, completion, failure, repair attempts, and (optionally) every heartbeat tick. All channels are optional and notification failures are silently swallowed -- they never crash the campaign.

| Channel | Config field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ntfy.sh | `ntfy_topic` | Push notifications via the ntfy app; default server `https://ntfy.sh` |
| Slack | `slack_webhook` | Incoming webhook URL (or `${ENV_VAR}` reference) |
| Telegram | `telegram_bot_token` + `telegram_chat_id` | Bot API |
| SMS (Twilio) | `twilio_account_sid` + `sms_to_number` | Via Twilio REST API |

See [`OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md`](OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md) for detailed setup instructions for each channel.

### Campaign Stage DAG

Stages form a dependency DAG defined by `depends_on` and `context_from` in `campaign.yaml`. The current muon campaign has this structure:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    theory1["theory1\n(math agents)"]
    experiments["experiments"]
    theory2["theory2\n(scaling theory)"]
    paper["paper\n(PDF required)"]

    theory1 -->|"depends_on + context_from"| experiments
    experiments -->|"depends_on + context_from"| theory2
    theory1 -->|"context_from"| theory2
    theory1 -->|"depends_on"| paper
    experiments -->|"depends_on + context_from"| paper
    theory2 -->|"depends_on + context_from"| paper
```

`depends_on` is an ordering gate -- the downstream stage will not launch until all listed stages are `completed`. `context_from` additionally resumes the upstream workspace and injects its memory summary into the task prompt.

### HTTP Steering Quick Reference

```bash
# Pause running stage
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5002/interrupt

# Inject instruction
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5002/instruction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"focus on linear case only","type":"m"}'

# Check paused status + queue depth
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5002/status
```

### SLURM / HPC Deployment

The heartbeat uses configurable circuit breakers (`max_idle_ticks`, `max_campaign_hours`) to detect and halt stuck campaigns -- see [Circuit Breakers](#circuit-breakers) below.

All cluster-specific settings -- partitions, GPU types, conda paths, module loads -- are centralized in `engaging_config.yaml`. The heartbeat runs on a CPU partition; experiment GPU jobs and repair agents are submitted as separate SLURM jobs.

```bash
# Submit a stage as a SLURM job
sbatch scripts/launch_multiagent_slurm.sh [optional_launch_args]

# Check job status
squeue -u $USER
```

See `engaging_config.yaml` for cluster partition/resource definitions and [`OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md`](OpenClaw_Use_Guide.md) for scheduling alternatives (cron, shell loop).

OpenClaw sequencing is at the **campaign/workspace** level. Each launched run still uses the internal single-run graph documented above, including parallel track routing, follow-up replanning, and the final validation loop.

What to inspect first:

1. `final_paper.tex` / `final_paper.pdf`
2. `paper_workspace/track_decomposition.json`
3. `experiment_workspace/experiment_design.json` and `experiment_workspace/verification_results.json`
4. `paper_workspace/followup_decision.json`
5. `math_workspace/claim_graph.json` and `math_workspace/checks/*.jsonl` (if math enabled)
6. `budget_state.json` and `budget_ledger.jsonl`

## Quality Gates and Artifact Contracts

When `--enforce-paper-artifacts` is active, the final validation gate checks for:

- `final_paper.tex`
- `paper_workspace/track_decomposition.json`
- `paper_workspace/literature_review.pdf`
- `paper_workspace/research_plan.pdf`
- `paper_workspace/results_assessment.pdf`
- `paper_workspace/followup_decision.json`
- optionally `final_paper.pdf` (`--require-pdf`)
- optionally `experiments_to_run_later.md` (`--require-experiment-plan`)

Additional strict checks with `--enforce-editorial-artifacts` include:

- `paper_workspace/author_style_guide.md`
- `paper_workspace/intro_skeleton.tex`
- `paper_workspace/style_macros.tex`
- `paper_workspace/reader_contract.json`
- `paper_workspace/editorial_contract.md`
- `paper_workspace/theorem_map.json`
- `paper_workspace/revision_log.md`
- `paper_workspace/copyedit_report.tex`
- `paper_workspace/review_report.tex`
- `paper_workspace/review_verdict.json`
- `paper_workspace/claim_traceability.json` (when math agents are enabled)

Additional strict validations include:

- review score threshold (`--min-review-score`)
- paper quality validation
- math acceptance/dependency consistency
- claim traceability checks (editorial + math runs)

The proofreading and reviewer agents produce `.tex`/`.pdf` report artifacts; the validation gate checks for the `.tex` source files listed above. The `.pdf` compiled outputs are produced alongside them but are not individually gated.

## Submission Checklist (NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR)

PoggioAI/MSc produces a paper draft, not a submission-ready manuscript. Before submitting to any venue, complete this human verification checklist:

### Novelty and Positioning
- [ ] Verify the core claim is genuinely novel by searching recent proceedings (not just arXiv) for the same or equivalent result.
- [ ] Confirm the paper clearly states its contribution relative to the closest prior work identified by the literature review agent.
- [ ] Check that the "Related Work" section does not misrepresent cited papers.

### Baselines and Experiments
- [ ] Confirm baselines are appropriate and fairly tuned (not strawman comparisons).
- [ ] Verify reported numbers by re-running at least one key experiment independently.
- [ ] Check that evaluation metrics match the venue's norms for the paper's subfield.
- [ ] Inspect generated figures for mislabeled axes, truncated ranges, or misleading scales.

### Citations and References
- [ ] Spot-check at least 10 citations: verify the cited paper exists, the claim attributed to it is accurate, and it is not retracted.
- [ ] Confirm `references.bib` entries have correct author names, titles, years, and venues.
- [ ] Check for missing citations to foundational or directly competing work.

### Writing and Ethics
- [ ] Read the full paper for coherence, logical flow, and AI-voice artifacts.
- [ ] Write or revise the ethics/broader-impact section manually (venue-specific requirements vary).
- [ ] Verify the abstract accurately reflects the paper's actual results and claims.
- [ ] Confirm the paper meets the venue's formatting requirements (page limits, style file, anonymization).

### Final Validation
- [ ] Compile the LaTeX locally and verify the PDF renders correctly.
- [ ] Run a plagiarism/AI-text-detection check if required by the venue.
- [ ] Have at least one domain expert read the paper before submission.

## Math Workflow

For math-heavy usage, see `MATH_RESEARCH_PRIMER.md`.

Common math artifacts:

- `math_workspace/claim_graph.json`

- `math_workspace/checks/<claim_id>.jsonl`
- `math_workspace/lemma_library.md`

Lemma library CLI:

## Runtime and Cost Expectations

Runtime depends on task scope, enabled gates, backend choice, and revision loops. All CLI agent invocations are included in your subscription plan (Claude Max, ChatGPT Pro, Gemini Advanced, etc.) -- there are no per-token costs.

| Configuration | Typical Invocations | Typical Runtime | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quickstart (markdown, no counsel) | 20-60 | 15-40 min | Single backend |
| Base pipeline + LaTeX PDF | 60-150 | 30-90 min | Requires pdflatex installed |
| Base pipeline + math agents | 100-250 | 60-150 min | Adds 6 math stages |
| Counsel mode (3-backend debate) | 200-600 | 2-5 hrs | Requires all 3 CLI tools |
| Tree search (no counsel) | 200-500 | 2-4 hrs | ~3x per claim (max_breadth=3) |
| Tree search + counsel (all nodes) | 500-1500 | 4-10 hrs | Maximum quality |
| Full paper campaign (3 stages) | 300-800 | 6-12 hrs | Via OpenClaw orchestration |

> **Budget cap**: The default `.llm_config.yaml` cap is 200 invocations and 7200 seconds wall-clock time. Increase `budget.max_invocations` and `budget.max_wall_clock_seconds` for production campaigns.

For counsel-heavy runs, monitor:

- `budget_state.json` -- invocation counts by backend
- `budget_ledger.jsonl` -- per-call invocation log
- `run_summary.json` -- final invocation/time summary written at completion

## Counsel Mode (Multi-Model Debate)

Counsel mode (`--enable-counsel`) replaces single-backend execution at each pipeline stage with a parallel multi-backend debate and synthesis protocol.

### Participating Backends

By default, three CLI agent backends run independently, with a separate synthesis backend:

| Slot | Backend | CLI Tool | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| 0 | claude | `claude` | Claude Max / Team subscription |
| 1 | codex | `codex` | ChatGPT Pro / Plus subscription |
| 2 | gemini | `gemini` | Gemini Advanced subscription |
| synthesis | claude | `claude` | Reviews all solutions and debate rounds |

Custom backend specs can be set in `.llm_config.yaml` under `counsel.models`.

### Debate Protocol

Each pipeline stage runs through four phases:

1. **Sandbox phase** (parallel): Each CLI backend receives the same task and system prompt but works in an isolated copy of the workspace (`counsel_sandboxes/<agent>/<backend>/`). All three backends execute simultaneously via `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
2. **Debate phase** (parallel per round): After all sandbox runs complete, each backend critiques all three solutions. This runs for `max_debate_rounds` rounds (default: 3, configurable via `--counsel-max-debate-rounds` or `CONSORTIUM_COUNSEL_MAX_DEBATE_ROUNDS`). Each round's critiques run in parallel.
3. **Synthesis phase**: The synthesis backend (default: `claude`, configurable in `.llm_config.yaml`) reviews all solutions and all debate rounds, then produces a single authoritative output for the stage.
4. **Artifact promotion**: Files from each sandbox are merged into the main workspace. Later sandboxes win on file-level conflicts (last-write-wins).

### When to Use Counsel

- Use counsel when quality matters more than time (e.g., final paper runs, important campaigns).
- Counsel helps most on stages where model disagreement reveals weaknesses: literature review, experiment design, writeup.
- Skip counsel (`--no-counsel`) for iterative development, quickstart runs, or time-sensitive exploration.

### Performance Impact

- Counsel multiplies per-stage invocations by roughly 4-5x (3 independent backend runs + 3 rounds of 3 debate calls + 1 synthesis call).
- Wall-clock time increases modestly because sandbox and debate phases run in parallel, but total runtime is still longer due to synthesis and sequential stage execution.
- Requires all three CLI tools installed and authenticated: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`.

### Counsel Precedence

1. `--no-counsel` disables counsel even if `counsel.enabled: true` in config.
2. `--enable-counsel` enables counsel even if `counsel.enabled: false` in config.
3. If neither flag is passed, the `counsel.enabled` value from `.llm_config.yaml` is used.

## Agentic Tree Search

Tree search (`--enable-tree-search`) replaces the linear proof stage in the theory track with parallel exploration of multiple proof strategies, selecting the best results via LLM-guided scoring.

Inspired by the AI Scientist-v2 progressive agentic tree search (paper 2504.08066v1), adapted for mathematical research where the claim graph imposes a DAG dependency structure. Tree search is scoped to the theory track (proof stage) because that is where the pipeline has a genuine combinatorial bottleneck: proofs are binary (valid or not), alternative strategies are well-defined, and the claim graph provides real prioritisation signal.

Internally, each tree search branch invokes `cli_completion()` to obtain LLM reasoning for strategy generation, proof attempts, and branch scoring.

### How It Works

The tree search controller operates in a **DAG-layered best-first** loop:

1. **Identify frontier claims** -- claims in the claim graph whose dependencies are all resolved
2. **Generate proof strategies** -- for each frontier claim, produce N alternative approaches (e.g., direct proof, contradiction, alternative lemma chain)
3. **Score branches** -- composite score: 40% LLM promise + 25% claim graph impact + 15% cost efficiency + 10% depth penalty + 10% sibling diversity
4. **Execute top-K branches in parallel** -- each branch runs in a forked workspace through the full prover -> rigorous verifier -> empirical verifier pipeline
5. **Process results** -- successful branches are promoted, failed branches spawn debugging children (up to `max_depth`), low-scoring branches are pruned

### Integration Point

Tree search hooks into the **theory track**, replacing the linear prover -> verifier chain with a tree search controller that explores multiple proof strategies per claim in parallel.

### Tree Search Node Types

| Node Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PROOF_STRATEGY` | Alternative approach to proving a claim |
| `LEMMA_DECOMPOSITION` | Alternative lemma chain supporting a theorem |
| `ASSUMPTION_VARIANT` | Proof under weakened or strengthened assumptions |
| `DEBUGGING` | Child branch addressing gaps from a failed proof |
| `INDEPENDENT_VERIFICATION` | Cross-check via a different verification method |
| `COMPONENT_ABLATION` | Ablation testing a proof component in isolation |

### Composition with Counsel

Tree search and counsel are orthogonal:

- **Tree search** = same backend, different tasks (explore N strategies in parallel)
- **Counsel** = different backends, same task (3-backend debate per strategy)

They compose: each tree branch can run the full counsel debate. `--tree-counsel-mode` controls when counsel runs within branches:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `all_nodes` (default) | Every tree node gets full 3-backend debate. Maximum quality. |
| `final_only` | Only the winning branch runs counsel after tree selection. |
| `by_depth` | Counsel at specified tree depths only. |
| `by_node_type` | Counsel only on high-stakes node types (e.g., `PROOF_STRATEGY`). |

With `max_breadth=3` and 3 counsel backends, this means 9 parallel agent runs per claim at the proof stage.

### Tree Search Artifacts

When tree search is enabled, the workspace includes:

- `tree_search_state.json` -- serialized tree state (all nodes, scores, statuses)
- `tree_branches/<branch_id>/` -- forked workspace per branch

### Configuration

Tree search is off by default. Enable via CLI flags:

```bash
--enable-tree-search            # activate tree search
--tree-max-breadth 3            # branches per decision point (default: 3)
--tree-max-depth 4              # max debugging recursion (default: 4)
--tree-max-parallel 6           # max concurrent branches (default: 6)
--tree-pruning-threshold 0.2    # prune branches scoring below this (default: 0.2)
--tree-counsel-mode all_nodes   # counsel integration mode (default: all_nodes)
```

## Experiment Execution Safety Model

### What IS in Place

- **Subprocess isolation**: `RunExperimentTool` launches the experiment runner (`experiment_runner.py`) as a child process via `subprocess.run()`. Experiment code runs in a dedicated `experiment_runs/<uuid>/` directory, separate from the main workspace. The experiment runner implements a lightweight 4-stage loop (design, implement, execute, analyze) driven by CLI agents.
- **Timeout enforcement**: Local subprocess mode enforces `CONSORTIUM_EXPERIMENT_TIMEOUT` (default: 3600 seconds). If the experiment exceeds this, the subprocess is killed.
- **SLURM mode** (when `CONSORTIUM_SLURM_ENABLED=1`): Experiments are submitted as SLURM batch jobs with configurable partition, time limit, GPU allocation, and memory. SLURM's own resource enforcement applies.
- **Budget cap**: The overall invocation limit prevents unbounded CLI agent usage during experiments.
- **Input validation**: The tool validates that research ideas conform to the expected JSON schema before launching.
- **Docker support**: A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are provided for running the entire pipeline in a container, which provides filesystem and process isolation.

### What is NOT in Place

- **No per-experiment Docker/container isolation**: When running locally (not via Docker), experiments execute as the same OS user with full filesystem access. There is no per-experiment container, namespace, or chroot.
- **No cgroup/ulimit enforcement** (local mode): CPU, memory, and disk usage are unbounded beyond the subprocess timeout.
- **No network isolation**: Experiment code can make arbitrary network requests.
- **No code review gate**: AI-generated experiment code is executed without human review. The `experiment_verification_agent` checks results after execution, not code before execution.

### Recommendations for Production Use

- Run the pipeline inside Docker (`docker compose run consortium ...`) for filesystem isolation.
- On HPC clusters, use SLURM mode (`CONSORTIUM_SLURM_ENABLED=1`) to leverage cluster-level resource enforcement.
- Set a conservative `CONSORTIUM_EXPERIMENT_TIMEOUT` for untrusted or exploratory tasks.
- Review generated experiment code in `experiment_runs/` before trusting results.

## Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError` (`yaml`, etc.)

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh researchlab minimal
conda activate researchlab
python scripts/preflight_check.py
```

### Missing web stack (`crawl4ai`, etc.)

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh researchlab web
```

### Playwright Chromium missing

```bash
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### LaTeX tools missing (`pdflatex` / `bibtex`)

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh researchlab latex
python scripts/preflight_check.py --with-latex
```

If conda TeX formats are broken:

```bash
./scripts/fix_pdflatex_conda.sh researchlab
```

### `pydub` warning about `ffmpeg`

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### No CLI agent tool detected

Verify that at least one CLI tool is installed and on your PATH:

```bash
which claude || which codex || which gemini
```

If none is found, install one (see [CLI Agent Tools](#cli-agent-tools)).

### Reduce citation retries

```bash
export CONSORTIUM_SS_MAX_RETRIES=2
export CONSORTIUM_SS_BASE_DELAY_SEC=2
export CONSORTIUM_SS_COOLDOWN_SEC=60
```

### Limit oversized tool outputs

```bash
export CONSORTIUM_SEE_FILE_MAX_CHARS=12000
export CONSORTIUM_SEARCH_MAX_CHARS=12000
export CONSORTIUM_SEARCH_MAX_MATCHES=200
```

## Empirical Quality Evidence

_This section is a placeholder for benchmark results measuring the quality of PoggioAI/MSc-generated papers._

Planned metrics:
- **Artifact completion rate**: Fraction of runs that produce all required artifacts without manual intervention.
- **Reviewer score distribution**: Histogram of `overall_score` values from the internal reviewer agent across a test suite of tasks.
- **Citation accuracy**: Spot-check accuracy rate of generated `references.bib` entries against ground truth.
- **Experiment reproducibility**: Rate at which generated experiments produce consistent results across repeated runs.
- **Invocation efficiency**: Median invocation count per completed paper draft across task categories.

We will publish benchmark results here once a standardized evaluation suite is available.
